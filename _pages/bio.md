<body>
<p style="font-size:0.7em;">I grew up in Gwangalli, what a lovely beach, Busan, South Korea. My hometown is one of the most fascinating and fantastic cities to me.<br>
  I was born in the same year with 
  <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7027783/"><b><font color="black">손석구(Son, Suk-ku)</font></b></a>
  , 
  <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://www.instagram.com/kimheenim?igsh=emhwNnM2YXJ2aTNp"><b><font color="black">김희철(Kim, Heechul)</font></b></a>
  and graduated from the same university with
  <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1454896/"><b><font color="black">김태희(Kim, Tae-hee)</font></b></a>
  on the exactly same day.<br>
  However, the MOST AMAZING Thing is that I might take the course of <b>Quantumn Physics in the department of Physics</b> with 
  <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://web.math.princeton.edu/~huh/"><b><font color="black">허준이</font></b></a>
  , who is very well-known for the winner of <b>'Fields Medal'</b> in 2022 from IMU.<br>

  I am currently living in the second LIFE. Warmly Welcome and please feel free to contact me via email whatever :)
