I grew up in Gwangalli, what a lovely beach, Busan, South Korea. My hometown is one of the most fascinating and fantastic cities to me.
I was born in the same year with 손석구, 김희철 and graduated from the same university with 김태희.
However, the most important thing I would like to highlight is that I might take the course of Quantumn Physics in the department of Physics with 허준이 well known for the winner of 'Fields Medal' from IMU.
